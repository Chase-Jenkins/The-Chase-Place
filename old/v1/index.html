        <h1>Hey! Look at me!</h1>
        <p>
            Glad you took a look. Listen here, I don't actually design websites.
            In fact, I had absolutely no experience with GIMP until I decided to
            build this website. But, on the other hand, I can build the heck out
            of any design you put in front of me. In fact, I think that's why you
            should consider me for any job you have regarding application
            development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hire me.</strong> If this website isn't enough to tell you
            that I work hard, I don't know what will. Actually, I would
            probably be willing to talk to you about the work that I can do
            in-person. Go ahead and contact me.

        Shoot. You made it to the bottom of the webpage. Not much to look at.
