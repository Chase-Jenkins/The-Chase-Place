                My name is Chase Jenkins, and this is my place. We don't get too many visitors around these parts, so I'm glad you're here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a technology enthusiast. I've been working more with hardware lately, but my roots are related to programming.

            <h1>The history?</h1>
            <p>
                It's a pretty simple story. I was set on becoming some sort of code developer since 2013. I surrounded myself with technology and soaked up whatever knowledge I could find.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating college in 2020, I was set on becoming a web developer. I wanted to make websites that were accessible, pretty to look at, and helpful to my community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first job in the world of information technology had me repairing laptops, building and organizing network infrastructure, and managing thousands of user accounts. Exactly what I was doing for my own high school, but with a lot more responsibility. It was a shock when I realized that I really enjoyed doing those sorts of things, especially after dreaming about becoming a coder for the majority of my mature life.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career dreams took a bit of a turn, and now I'm interested in a different section of the industry.

            Glad you took a look. Listen here, I don't actually design websites.
            In fact, I had absolutely no experience with GIMP until I decided to
            build this website. But, on the other hand, I can build the heck out
            of any design you put in front of me. In fact, I think that's why you
            should consider me for any job you have regarding application
            development.
        </p>

            <strong>Hire me.</strong> If this website isn't enough to tell you
            that I work hard, I don't know what will. Actually, I would
            probably be willing to talk to you about the work that I can do
            in-person. Go ahead and contact me.
